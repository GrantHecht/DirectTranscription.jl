Currently, upper and lower boundaries for algebraic
path functions are set via a phase method and point
functions have no method for setting boundaries.

I think I should transition to setting boundaries for 
all algebraic functions (point and path) in the user
function object itself rather than one of the container 
objects. Then, one of the FunctionData objects can 
be setup with the full boundaries for the phase 
(i.e., boundaries at every point) or the NLP problem 
(i.e., point functions applied at arbitrary points).

Plan to set this up for point functions first, as this
must be done before I can get trajectory optimization working.
Then, I'll go back and update the path function interface.
